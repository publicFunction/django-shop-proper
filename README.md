This is a Django Shop done properly...

I hope. LOL

Please use the local_settings.py for deployment and for local/staging development. This will stop the issues faced with multiple devs changing the settings.py file and getting conflicts.
I have only added this for any dev using it.

NOTE:	PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT THE LOCAL SETTINGS FILE BACK TO THE REPOSITORY. THIS WILL JUST GIVE THE SAME ISSUES AS MENTIONED ABOVE.
	ONCE CLONED, SET UP THE FILE AND FORGET ABOUT IT, ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE.
	USE THE SETTINGS FILE AS NORMAL FOR ADDING NEW APPS OR GLOBAL SETTINGS FROM ANY 3RD PARTY APPS.
